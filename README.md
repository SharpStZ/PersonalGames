These projects of mine were developed in GameMaker Studio 2, and most of them were either tests, or university projects. 
These vere made starting from 2023, and they're fairly small, most of them not even finished!

Of course, I have wayy more projects up my sleeve, but they're mostly smaller tests on how rendering stuff works, battle concepts, etc. 
The only test project I decided to upload was the "2D WorldGen attempt" project, as I'm really proud of that one, and it's a fairly hefty project of mine.
