These projects of mine were developed in GameMaker Studio 2, and most of them were either tests, or university projects. 
These vere made starting from 2023, and they're fairly small, most of them not even finished!

Of course, I have wayy more projects up my sleeve, but they're mostly smaller tests on how rendering stuff works, battle concepts, etc. 
The only test project I decided to upload was the "2D WorldGen attempt" project, as I'm really proud of that one, and it's a fairly hefty project of mine.

All of these are fairly irrelevant, but I have something BIG planned. A fully-fledged 2.5d RPG, inspired by Omori and Undertale, which I'll start working on in the upcoming year or two.
It will have:
-> A unique turn-based battle concept, relying heavy on high-risk, high-reward abilities and strategizing next moves;

-> A unique magical world, with its own lore, inner workings, power dynamics, and so on;

-> A heavy emphasis on player choice, and multiple endings depending on these choices. that includes:

--> A heavy emphasis on repeating the game and trying something else you wouldn't be able to know prior, like secret puzzles;

--> Friend-enemy dynamics, which could alter the story drastically trough butterfly effect;

--> Different paths on how to get more powerful, each altering battle strategies as the game goes on;  

-> A pixel-art artstyle, and about 15-20hrs length gameplay per route.

--> I do plan on releasing different routes further in, not as a completed game. Not chapters, but more like updates.

--> Most routes will explore the same world and areas, so they're not completely different games, just different events, relationships, etc.

Of course, this is a LOT to digest, and it's fairly vague as I don't want to reveal the theming of the game itself. 
I'm a bit lazy, can admit, but I really do want to make something people will enjoy a lot.
